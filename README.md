MindScribe is a full-stack web application that allows users to create threads by providing description and attaching image, toggle between public and private visibility, and manage their content with CRUD operations. Public threads are visible to other users, who can react with likes or dislikes triggering notifications for thread owner. Users can also export their threads as PDFs and view thread activity analytics in the form of graphs.
