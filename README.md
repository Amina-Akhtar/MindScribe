MindScribe is a full-stack web app that allows users to create threads and attach image, toggle between public and private visibility, and manage their content with CRUD operations. Public threads are visible to other users, who can react with likes or dislikes triggering notifications for thread owner. Users can also export their threads as PDFs and view thread activity analytics in the form of graphs.
